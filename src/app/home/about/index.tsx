      <p className="text-md pb-8">
        Hello! I am a long-time enthusiast of hybrid mobile technology, working
        in the software development space since 2013. I started my journey using
        AngularJs and jQuery to create apps with PhoneGap, and since then I have
        explored different tools like Angular, React and, more recently, Dart
        and Flutter.
      </p>
      <p className="text-md pb-8">
        After a few years focusing mainly on front-end development, I returned
        to the world of mobile apps in late 2021 and completely fell in love
        with Dart and Flutter. Currently, I am part of the first mobile-focused
        team at TOTVs - CMNet, where I have the opportunity to develop libraries
        and applications for Android and iOS.
      </p>
      <p className="text-md pb-8">
        I love facing challenges and adapting quickly to new technologies.
        Always looking for innovation, I like to collaborate on projects that
        have a real and positive impact. If you&apos;re interested in mobile
        technology or just want to exchange ideas on the subject, I&apos;m
        always open for a conversation! Let&apos;s connect?
